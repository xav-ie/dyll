# Dynamically Loaded Libraries in C

This is an experiment testing how one might try and dynamically load their libraries in a program at runtime. I think it is pretty awesome, because the programmer has complete control in their C program as to how the libaries should load in and when.

I hope this example will help me in the future when I try to load libraries at runtime in the future.

## Examples:

- `./test.elf ./libplus1.so 42`
- `./test.elf ./libplus2.so 5`
